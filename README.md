## 📄Overview
The Currency Converter Application is a user-friendly tool designed to provide real-time currency conversion between various world currencies. It uses a public API to fetch and display the latest exchange rates and provides an intuitive interface for users to convert between selected currencies.

## ✅Features
Real-time Exchange Rates Display
The application header prominently displays the latest exchange rates for popular global currencies (USD, EUR) against the Ukrainian hryvnia (UAH). These rates are fetched from a reliable public API to ensure accuracy and real-time updates.

## 🧮Dynamic Currency Conversion
The application's primary function is to allow users to convert between various currencies. Users can select their "base" and "target" currencies from the dropdown menu, which includes at least UAH, USD, and EUR. After entering the desired amount in the base currency, the application will automatically calculate and display the equivalent amount in the target currency. This conversion process is bi-directional and dynamically updates in real-time with any changes to the input amount or selected currencies.

## 💎Additional Features
Aside from its core functionalities, the application is designed with the end-user in mind. It features a well-organized, intuitive user interface and maintains a high standard of code cleanliness and efficiency.
